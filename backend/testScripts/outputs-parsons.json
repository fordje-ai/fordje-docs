No person shall operate a work-site utility vehicle on any public highway, street, road or alley within the corporate limits of the City unless such person has a valid driver's license. Unless the State of Kansas requires all work-site utility vehicles to be registered with the state as a motor vehicle, all work-site utility vehicles shall have prominently displayed a valid permit issued by the City of Parsons allowing the operation of that particular vehicle within the City limits. Said permit shall be issued by the City of Parsons after inspection by the City to ensure that all equipment and insurance requirements of this section are met and upon proof said vehicle has been registered for personal property tax purposes in the county the permit holder resides. An annual fee of $72 shall be paid per permit with each permit being good from July 1 until June 30 of the following year. Said fee shall be prorated from the month of issuance until the following July for newly issued permits. Said permits are not transferable to other work-site utility vehicles. If the State of Kansas requires all work-site utility vehicles to be registered with the state as a motor vehicle, then said work-site utility vehicles shall not be required to obtain a permit from the City of Parsons.
